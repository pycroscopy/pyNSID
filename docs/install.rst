Installation
============

pyNSID is currently under development but should be available soon for usage.

Interested users are recommended to git clone our GitHub repository, checkout the ``dev`` branch, and add the path to this directory to your system / python path via:

.. code-block::

   sys.path.append('/path/to/pyNSID')

We do not recommend installing this package via ``pip install`` or ``python setup.py install`` since this package is in its very early stages of development
